want to keep track of:
if up:
 - motd (HTML-escaped)
 - number of players
 - max # of players
 - last time down (for uptime)
 - timestamp
if down:
 - last time up
 - timestamp
if error:
 - error

NOTE: if either players or max_players is not reported by the server, canary will report the value as -1.

Error:
{
    "error": "error message"
}
Up:
{
    "lastchange": "2012-04-17T16:21:04.732000+00:00", 
    "max_players": 100, 
    "motd": "Nerd.Nu", 
    "players": 38, 
    "server": "p.nerd.nu", 
    "status": "up", 
    "timestamp": "2012-04-17T16:21:14.435000+00:00", 
    "reference_timestamp": "2012-04-17T16:21:14.435000+00:00"
}
Down:
{
    "lastchange": "2012-04-17T16:28:04.185000+00:00", 
    "server": "p.nerd.nu", 
    "status": "down", 
    "timestamp": "2012-04-17T16:21:14.435000+00:00",
